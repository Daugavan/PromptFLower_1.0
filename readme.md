What the tool is:

PrompFlower 1.0 is a command-line tool that generates AI prompts entirely locally and offline using a local AI engine via Ollama. This means that no data is sent to external servers, making it a private and secure tool for creating effective prompts directly on your device.

What PromptFlower 1.0 offers:

Offline generation of AI prompts using Ollama.
Complete privacy, as no internet connection is required.
Flexible customization for different types of prompts.
Runs directly in the terminal with simple commands.
You need to run an Ollama server on your device to use this script. Once your server is up and running, use one of these commands:

How to use:

CMD-mode:
Simply run the Python script in CMD with "python PrompFlower_1.0_main.py". (You need to navigate the terminal windows to the directory where the script is located.)

EXE-mode:
Simply run the file "PrompFlower 1.0.exe".

Web browser-mode:
Run: "PrompFlower 1.0.exe --web"
If that doesn't work try ".\PrompFlower 1.0.exe --web"

A link will be generated, and all you have to do is visit it through your web browser.
